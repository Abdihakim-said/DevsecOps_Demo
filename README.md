**The Problem**
**The key problems that DevSecOps aims to solve are:**

Security Vulnerabilities in AI-Generated Code: The growing use of AI-powered tools, such as code generation assistants, has introduced new security challenges. These AI-generated code snippets may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities, such as hardcoded credentials or the use of outdated, vulnerable dependencies.

Outdated and Vulnerable Dependencies: Developers may inadvertently use outdated or vulnerable software dependencies, exposing the application to known exploits and potential security breaches.

Compliance and Regulatory Requirements: Many industries and organizations are subject to various compliance and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS. Ensuring that the application and its delivery process meet these requirements can be a significant challenge.

**The Solution**
To address these problems, a DevOps engineer can implement a DevSecOps pipeline that incorporates the following security practices and tools:

Static Code Analysis: Integrate a static code analysis tool, such as SonarQube, to scan the codebase for common security vulnerabilities, coding best practices, and code quality issues.

Dependency Scanning: Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool, like OWASP Dependency Check, to scan the project dependencies for known vulnerabilities and ensure the use of secure, up-to-date versions.

Infrastructure as Code Scanning: Leverage a tool like Checkov to scan infrastructure as code (e.g., Terraform configurations) for security misconfigurations and enforce secure cloud resource configurations.

Container Security: Integrate a container security scanning tool, such as Trivy, to scan container images for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance issues.

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Incorporate a DAST tool, like OWASP ZAP, to perform automated security testing on the application during the integration and deployment stages.

Security Monitoring and Alerting: Set up security monitoring and alerting mechanisms, integrating tools like a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform, to detect and respond to security incidents in the production environment.

**Outcome**
By implementing this DevSecOps pipeline, the DevOps engineer can achieve the following outcomes:

Improved Security Posture: The automated security checks and controls will help identify and address security vulnerabilities early in the development process, reducing the risk of security breaches and the associated business and reputational impact.

Compliance and Regulatory Adherence: The DevSecOps pipeline will help meet various compliance and regulatory requirements by embedding security controls and monitoring throughout the software delivery lifecycle.

Increased Efficiency and Scalability: The use of automation and standardized security practices will streamline the software delivery process, allowing the security efforts to be scaled across the organization.

Reduced Technical Debt: By addressing security issues early, the accumulation of technical debt and the costly consequences of security vulnerabilities in the long run can be avoided.

By integrating DevSecOps practices into the software delivery pipeline, DevOps engineers can build more secure, resilient, and compliant applications, ultimately reducing the risk of security breaches and the associated business impact.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Board.tsx       # Game board component
│   ├── Square.tsx      # Individual square component
│   ├── ScoreBoard.tsx  # Score tracking component
│   └── GameHistory.tsx # Game history component

```

## Game Logic

The game implements the following rules:

1. X goes first, followed by O
2. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
3. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw
4. Winning combinations are highlighted
5. Game statistics are tracked and displayed

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devsecops-demo.git
   cd devsecops-demo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
